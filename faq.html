            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes, but you may run into some issues. The website design isn't optimized for small screens and any
                    feature that requires pressing hotkeys won't work without an external keyboard.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">How/Why was Livecountsedit created?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Livecountsedit was created with a Discord user called "Sync" sent a DM to RandomPerson3465 about
                    editing
                    Livecounts.net subscriber counts. Livecountsedit 1.0 used a copy of the <a
                        href="https://livecounts.net">Livecounts.net</a> website design. The idea for fake subscriber
                    counts
                    goes back to PewDiePie vs. T-Series, during which RandomPerson3465 uploaded a video of T-Series
                    "losing"
                    subscribers on a modified SocialBlade live subscriber count on <span class="date"
                        ts="2019-01-22T17:00:00Z">22 January 2019</span>, and an April Fools video of T-Series "losing"
                    subscribers due to an audit on Akshatmittal live sub count. Both of these videos have been deleted.
