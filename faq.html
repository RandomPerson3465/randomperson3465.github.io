            <button type="button" class="question">When is Livecountsedit v4.1 / v5 releasing?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Livecountsedit 4.1 was renamed to v5, and there is currently no ETA for it.</p>
            </div>

            <button type="button" class="question">You promised an update on [date], that day has come but why isn't it out yet?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>There are a few reasons for this.<br><strong>1. RandomPerson3465 lives in the PST/PDT timezone, or UTC-8 and UTC-7 during daylight savings. He tends to release updates at around 3-11 PM so if you live in timezones UTC-2 or ahead add one day to release dates that don't have a release time. If there is a release time, just convert the time from PST/PDT to your timezone.</strong><br>2. The update may have been delayed. Please check his <a href="https://twitter.com/randomguy3465">Twitter</a> for updates.<br>3. An unexpected event happened on the release date that causes him to not be able to release the update or notify you of it.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">Does Livecountsedit work on mobile?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Yes, but you may run into some issues. The website design isn't optimized for small screens and any
                    feature that requires pressing hotkeys won't work without an external keyboard.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">How do I open up the options menu in Livecountsedit?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>On versions before v4, and the old compare mode, all the options should be on the top left of the screen. On regular mode v4, click or tap the "Options" text at the bottom left corner of the screen, and on the new compare mode there should be a gear icon on the top left.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">Do I have to give credit to RandomPerson3465 when using Livecountsedit in my content?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>You are not required to give credit whenever you use Livecountsedit in your content.</p>

        <div>
            <button type="button" class="question">Why are the keybinds not working?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>If keybinds are not working, try focusing on the body of the website by clicking or tapping the background. This is to prevent them from triggering when typing out channel names, counts, etc. On the new compare mode, make sure keybinds are enabled in the settings.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">Can you please add API updates to Livecountsedit?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Unfortunately YouTube's API has a lot of restrictions, so multiple people using this feature at once is more than enough to make the quota run out within an hour. Also, Livecountsedit is intended for making custom subscriber counts and not really for "estimations".</p>

        <div>
            <button type="button" class="question">Why is Livecountsedit v4 / the new compare mode so bad?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Livecountsedit v4 and the new compare mode have a different theme and different features because the old Livecountsedit was mostly copying off of <a href="https://livecounts.net">livecounts.net</a>'s design, and the input boxes were taking up a lot of space. If lag is your issue, that may be due to the Highcharts graph so you can disable the chart in the options and see if that helps. For the old Livecountsedit <a href="https://randomperson3465.github.io/livecountsedit/v3">click here</a>, and for the old compare mode <a href="https://randomperson3465.github.io/livecountsedit/compare/old">click here</a>.</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>To suggest a feature for Livecountsedit or the website in general, join the RandomPerson3465.github.io Discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/FRKWfDp">here</a>, then post your suggestion in the #website-suggestions channel. RandomPerson3465 will read every suggestion so please do not tag him or any staff members about it.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">How do I view the source code for the website?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>To view the source code for the website, press Ctrl+U if you are on a browser. You can also view the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/RandomPerson3465/randomperson3465.github.io">here</a>. Please note that the code for Livecountsedit is minified (so it loads up faster), and for versions released in early 2020 code is obfuscated (because of RandomPerson3465 being stupid at the time and confusing an "obfuscator" for a "minifier")</p>
