    <p>Invite for the RadomPerson3465.github.io Discord (formerly called Livecountsedit Discord) is <a href="https://discord.gg/FRKWfDp">https://discord.gg/FRKWfDp</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are muted or banned on the server, please appeal using <a href="https://forms.gle/iYwSUFKZT4v7sENn8">this form</a>. <strong>Please note that you will not get a response back, especially when you are banned.</strong> Appeals are reviewed every few days so wait at least 7 days after your appeal and see if you are unbanned. If you are appealing an 1 hour mute most likely your mute will end before we can review the appeal and revoke it, but if it is accepted we will remove any warnings associated with the mute.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">How do I get the Regular role?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The Regular role is given manually to more active members of the server. There are no specific requirements and this role currently doesn't grant any perks as of now.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">Why did I get muted?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>If you got muted, most likely you broke a rule or triggered an auto moderation filter. The default length for a mute is 1 hour and can be triggered by begging for updates, using blacklisted words, sending spam, getting too many warnings, etc. If you believe your mute should be revoked, appeal using the <a href="https://forms.gle/iYwSUFKZT4v7sENn8">punishment appeal form</a>.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">How do I become a staff/moderator?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Moderator applications are currently closed because we don't really need too many of them as the server is usually inactive. If moderator applications are open, we will announce in the server announcements channel.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">How do I get notified/pinged for updates?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Go to the #self-roles channel and react with the emoji that corresponds to the desired role. If Carl-bot is down or they don't work for whatever reason, try doing what is stated underneath the message with the reaction roles in the channel. If they still don't work, contact a server staff member.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">What are each of the self roles for?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>"Server Announcements Ping" is pinged for updates relating to the RandomPerson3465.github.io Discord server only. "Website Announcements Ping" is pinged whenever a planned update is <strong>announced</strong> for the website and not for when the update actually releases. "Website Update Ping" is pinged for whenever the website has a major update. You are allowed to select more than one of these ping roles or none at all.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">Why can't I post links to the website / for images / screenshots?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The reason for this is to prevent malicious links and advertisement spam. Unfortunately, "randomperson3465.github.io" and "cdn.discordapp.com" are both subdomains which means that whitelisting them will whitelist "github.io" and "discordapp.com" which will allow anything and also other subdomains of those sites to be posted.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">How do I appeal a punishment?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>Fill out the <a href="https://forms.gle/iYwSUFKZT4v7sENn8">punishments appeal form</a> to appeal a punishment. Note that you cannot appeal mutes that are less than 1 hour in length or individual warnings. If you have absolutely no idea why you got banned, check the "I don't know" box instead of making a silly guess.</p>

            <button type="button" class="question">Why is there a different "RandomPerson3465" account?</button>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>The different "RandomPerson3465" (full tag: RandomPerson3465#6553) is another one of RandomPerson3465's accounts, but he permanently lost access to it in August 2020. His current Discord tag is RandomPerson3465#0759, and his ID is 549471563616092171 in case his tag changes. Anyone else pretending to be RandomPerson3465 is a fake account and will be assigned a nickname indicating so.</p>
