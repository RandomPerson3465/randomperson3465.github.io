                    <p>It may be because he isn't feeling like it, or he has things like schoolwork to do. If an update isn't rescheduled yet still doesn't release on time, it may be because of IRL issues.</p>

                <button type="button" class="question">How/Why was Livecountsedit created?</button>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Livecountsedit was created with a Discord user called "Sync" sent a DM to RandomPerson3465 about editing Livecounts.net subscriber counts. Livecountsedit 1.0 used a copy of the <a href="https://livecounts.net">Livecounts.net</a> website design. The idea for fake subscriber counts goes back to PewDiePie vs. T-Series, during which RandomPerson3465 uploaded a video of T-Series "losing" subscribers on a modified SocialBlade live subscriber count on <span class="date" ts="2019-01-22T17:00:00Z">22 January 2019</span>, and an April Fools video of T-Series "losing" subscribers due to an audit on Akshatmittal live sub count. Both of these videos have been deleted.</p>
